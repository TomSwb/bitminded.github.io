# Catalog Page Plan

- **Purpose:** Present the full artisanal app lineup with origin stories, feature highlights, pricing (one-time + subscription), and clear calls to purchase or commission.
- **Layout Notes:**
  - Hero overview describing the catalog philosophy and commission-to-catalog model.
  - Filterable grid or list with app cards (title, tagline, badges for platform, price).
  - Inline expansion or modal for single-product details to avoid separate page.
- **Content Blocks:**
  - Featured apps section (e.g., `Rythmo`, `Measure Mate`) with short narratives.
  - “How commissions work” explainer linking to the services page.
  - Testimonials and social proof for trust.
  - Newsletter/signup hook for future releases.
- **Dependencies:** Needs product metadata (images, descriptions, pricing) and integration with navigation menu + Supabase entitlements if gating purchases.
