## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

### Core Vision

**Build a thriving community that sustains BitMinded through volume, engagement, and shared values.**

The community page is not just a feature—it's the foundation of BitMinded's sustainability model:

- **Volume Strategy:** 1000+ subscribers at CHF 5-8/month = CHF 5,000-8,000/month revenue
- **Stability:** Recurring revenue from community subscriptions enables flexibility for other services
- **Engagement:** Active community drives word-of-mouth, retention, and organic growth
- **Value:** Community members get value beyond just tools (connection, support, shared learning)

### Purpose Statement

**"A space where users connect, share experiences, review tools, and support the artisan approach to software. The community is the heart of BitMinded—where 'petite gens' come together to build better digital habits."**

## 💡 Community Strategy

### Volume-Based Sustainability

**Key Insight:** 1000 regular subscribers at CHF 5-8/month makes the overall lifestyle viable and provides stability for all other services.

**Revenue Model:**
- 1000 subscribers × CHF 5/month = CHF 5,000/month = CHF 60,000/year
- 1000 subscribers × CHF 8/month = CHF 8,000/month = CHF 96,000/year
- After Stripe fees (3%): CHF 4,850-7,760/month
- After tax (~25%): CHF 3,638-5,820/month = CHF 43,650-69,840/year

**Impact:**
- ✅ Provides stable base income
- ✅ Enables flexibility for commissions and guidance services
- ✅ Reduces pressure to maximize per-project pricing
- ✅ Allows focus on "petite gens" market (accessible pricing)
- ✅ Creates sustainable full-time work opportunity

### Community-Driven Growth

**Strategy:** Strong community fuels growth through:

1. **Word-of-Mouth:** Active, engaged community members share with friends/family
2. **Retention:** Community connection reduces churn and increases lifetime value
3. **Feedback Loop:** Community provides continuous feedback for tool improvements
4. **Social Proof:** Reviews and testimonials build trust and credibility
