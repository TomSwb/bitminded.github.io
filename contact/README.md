# Contact & Support Page Plan

- **Purpose:** Merge general contact information with support resources until the path is formally renamed to `/support`.
- **Immediate Content:**
  - Short introduction setting expectations for calm, judgment-free help.
  - Primary contact methods (form, email, phone/WhatsApp if applicable) and response times.
  - Quick-help pathways: booking a guidance session, reporting an app issue, or requesting commission discovery.
  - Links to self-serve resources (FAQ snippets, user guides) once authored.
- **Future Rename Checklist (contact → support):**
  - Update navigation menu labels/links and any references in `lang-contact` translations.
  - Adjust routing in `component-loader` or SPA navigation.
  - Ensure Supabase email templates and outbound messages reflect the new naming.
- **Operational Notes:**
  - Log inquiries in Supabase (support ticket table) to track trends.
  - Prepare canned response templates for guidance bookings, troubleshooting follow-ups, and commission intake.
