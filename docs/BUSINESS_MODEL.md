# 🪵 Artisanal Software Atelier – Business Model Canvas

## Value Proposition

- **Artisanal apps + human guidance under one roof:** Pair handcrafted software with judgment-free tech coaching so people gain tools *and* the confidence to use them.
- **Personal touch at human scale:** Small, purposeful apps and calm, one-to-one support delivered directly by the maker.
- **Commission-to-catalog model:** Clients fund the build at artisan rates, receive a perpetual-use license, and I retain rights to bring the tool into a growing catalog for others to enjoy.
- **Ethical, transparent craft:** Like Swiss artisans, I build sustainably and teach safe digital habits so trust compounds over time.

## Customer Segments

- Individuals with niche needs (personal productivity, lifestyle tools)
- Tech-anxious learners who want patient coaching to feel safe online (students, seniors, career shifters)
- Families seeking shared digital literacy rituals and healthy tech boundaries
- Small businesses & creatives needing lightweight, affordable, custom software
- Local communities & associations (schools, clubs, NGOs) who value tailored solutions and in-person guidance
- Supporters of indie/ethical software who choose artisan-made over corporate
