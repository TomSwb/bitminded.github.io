# 🪵 Artisanal Software Atelier – Business Model Canvas

## Value Proposition

- **Artisanal apps + human guidance under one roof:** Pair handcrafted software with judgment-free tech coaching so people gain tools *and* the confidence to use them.
- **Personal touch at human scale:** Small, purposeful apps and calm, one-to-one support delivered directly by the maker.
- **Commission-to-catalog model:** Clients who commission apps get them free (or discounted); I retain rights and add them to a growing catalog for others to enjoy.
- **Ethical, transparent craft:** Like Swiss artisans, I build sustainably and teach safe digital habits so trust compounds over time.
