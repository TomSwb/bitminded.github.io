# 🪵 Artisanal Software Atelier – Business Model Canvas

## Value Proposition

- **Handcrafted software, human-scale:** Small, clean, purposeful tools—never bloated mass-market apps.
- **Personal touch:** Built by one independent coder, with care and a clear philosophy.
- **Unique model:** Clients who commission apps get them free (or discounted); I retain rights and add them to my catalog for others to use.
- **Authenticity & trust:** Like Swiss artisans, I build sustainably, ethically, and transparently.

---

## Customer Segments

- Individuals with niche needs (personal productivity, lifestyle tools)
- Small businesses & creatives needing lightweight, affordable, custom software
- Communities & associations (schools, clubs, NGOs) who value tailored solutions
- Supporters of indie/ethical software who choose artisan-made over corporate

---

## Channels

- Personal website (homepage as the “atelier showcase”)
- Direct outreach (LinkedIn, forums, local entrepreneur circles, maker communities)
- Digital marketplaces (Gumroad, App Store, Google Play, GitHub Sponsors)
- Workshops, meetups, word of mouth (like artisans at local markets)

---

## Customer Relationships

- Transparent and human: direct contact with the maker
- Early adopters feel like patrons supporting the craft
- Ongoing updates and improvements, communicated personally

---

## Revenue Streams

- **Resale of artisanal apps:** Catalog grows with each commission
  - One-time purchase CHF 10–50
  - Subscription CHF 5–20/month (for cloud-based or regularly updated tools)
- **Custom commissions:** Client pays reduced fee or nothing, in exchange for resale rights
- **Workshops / consulting:** Teaching the artisanal coding approach or building custom tools for higher-end clients (CHF 100–300/session or CHF 2k–20k/project)

## 🌱 Growth Strategy (Artisan-style, not startup-style)

**Stage 1: Seed** – One small product + first commission, sold to niche
**Stage 2: Survival** – Use commissions to bootstrap while catalog grows
**Stage 3: Identity** – Strong “artisanal software” branding, every app fits the philosophy
**Stage 4: Sustainability** – Recurring income from catalog + optional consulting/workshops
**Stage 5: Expansion (optional)** – Stay small and personal, or grow into a boutique software studio
