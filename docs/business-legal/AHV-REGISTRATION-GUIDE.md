# AHV / AVS Self-Employment Registration Guide

Reference for deciding when and how to register as self-employed with the Swiss social security system while building BitMinded.

---

## 1. Purpose

- Understand the **obligation** to inform the cantonal compensation office (Ausgleichskasse / Caisse de compensation) once self-employed income becomes material.
- Prepare the **documents** needed for a smooth registration.
- Coordinate the process with the **ORP/RAV** and other authorities.

---

## 2. When to Register

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Exploratory work only** (no clients, CHF 0 revenue) | No registration required yet. Keep notes of prospects and ongoing preparation. |
| **Occasional micro-income** (≤ CHF 2 300/year) | Contributions can be waived, but keep records. Registration becomes relevant as soon as activity is regular or exceeds this threshold. |
| **Regular mandates or several clients** (even small amounts) | Prepare registration. The office looks for continuity and independence more than a minimum revenue figure. |
| **Projected profit ≥ CHF 3 000/year** or **multiple ongoing contracts** | Register as self-employed; the compensation office expects notification at this stage. |
| **Crossing CHF 100 000 turnover** | Separate duty: commercial register & VAT registration required. This is later, but note it for planning. |

Rule of thumb: file as soon as the activity is intended to continue and generates real income (multiple clients, recurring sessions, significant invoices), even if you are still below CHF 10 000.

## 3. Coordinating with ORP / RAV

- Inform your counselor when you start invoicing clients. They can confirm how it affects benefits.
- ORP often allows exploratory self-employment; once revenue becomes meaningful, they may transition you to self-employed status.
- Keep copies of all communications with ORP for your records.

## 4. Registration Checklist

1. **Download the form** “Anmeldung als Selbständigerwerbende/r” from your cantonal compensation office (for Vaud: CCVD).
2. **Gather supporting documents** (attach copies):
   - Identity document (passport or ID card).
   - Business description or short plan (what services you offer, target customers).
   - Signed contracts, invoices, or quotes showing client work in progress.
   - Proof of business address/home office declaration.
   - Banking details for contribution invoices.
3. **Provide income estimates**:
   - Expected annual turnover and net profit for the current year.
   - Indicate whether you intend to keep accounting records (yes).
4. **Submit application**:
   - By post, in person, or via online portal if available.
   - Keep a copy of the submission.
5. **Await decision**:
   - The office may request additional evidence (e.g., invoices, proof of independence).
   - Once accepted, you receive confirmation and provisional contribution bills (typically quarterly).

---

## 5. After Acceptance

- **Pay provisional contributions**: they are based on the profit estimate; adjustments are made after your tax return is processed.
- **Update estimates** if income changes significantly mid-year.
- **Maintain bookkeeping**:
  - Sequential invoices.
  - Receipts for expenses.
  - Ledger or accounting software—needed for both AHV and tax filings.
- **Keep documents for 10 years** (Swiss retention requirement).

---

## 6. If Revenue Is Very Low

- Below CHF 2 300/year, AHV contributions can be waived, but note that **no contributions = no credited income for pension**.
- Some freelancers register anyway to establish legal status early.
- Even without contributions, bookkeeping records must still be kept for tax purposes.

---

## 7. Additional Thresholds & Future Steps

- **Commercial Register & VAT**: required once turnover reaches CHF 100 000.
- **Professional insurance**: review liability coverage as soon as you work with paying clients.
- **Tax coordination**: self-employed accounts feed directly into your personal income tax return—keep the same records.
