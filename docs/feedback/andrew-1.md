Record of  whastapp conversation:

[09:17, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Nice to hear from you so rapidly! Glad to hear it went well! 

Im doing good! Had some back issue this week but getting over it, otherwise i have been working really hard on my project business! So very exciting and actually I am looking for insight of any kind and you know how i value your opinion 😉, would you mind check it out? I’m very excited about even if i have a lot of work to get done to get it going: bitminded.ch

[09:32, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: Hi Thomas. The website looks great! Nice style (from your wife, no doubt), with four languages (automatically in English for me) and dark/light modes. Clear explanations. The missing thing for me is a couple "success stories" or examples with explanation of the types of apps you've created for people or the types of problems you've helped them solve. At this point, these could be ways in which you could help people. I think a few actual or hypothetical examples can help ground this for people so they can say, "Oh, yeah, I could use that kind of help, too." Or "Oh, yeah, the app they built is like the one I would like to build." I heard that you want your reader to see themselves in your stories so they think, "Yes, this could benefit me, too."

[09:34, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Seems quite a fair assessment. I have an issue with writting success stories myself tho. But i do have in plans to add a whole review system. Would that be enough for then someone like you to write something? Or do you have advise on doing a success story myself?

[09:35, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Like maybe as an example you mean for my rythmo app, explain the story of my wife need and how it was solved?

[09:36, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: Maybe it's just me. Your descriptions sound good, but they're a bit too theoretical, and I need some practical examples to connect with.

[09:36, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: I agree

[09:37, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: I m just not sure what to say when i have not had customer yet but definitely can brainstorm that 😅

[09:37, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: Yes: What was the need, how you gathered requirements, what the app does, and how it helped your wife with her workouts.

[09:37, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Ok! That helps already! A good layout

[09:38, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: I could write something about the work you've done for me. I'm really busy these days. You could write something up for your work with me, and I can give feedback on it - that could work.

[09:39, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Thats sounds good too! No stress about it tho, i have a few other things i want to implement before making the review system. The plan is to actually start early next year so got time to do it correctly

[09:39, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: Also you'd want to write about how you interacted with the person for whom you created the app. I imagine, it may also be good to have a video, not just written.

[09:40, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: Yes, review system is good, but I'm thinking of one web page per success story, with one web page that houses them all.

[09:41, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: And all of that, would you more put it in the about pages? Or on the home page? Or completely a new page as you just said? I was thinking having a sub page inside the about and then a sample showing on the home page

[09:42, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Kinda like: Vision & Mission, The team, Success Stories

[09:42, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: As the structure in about

[09:43, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: I think it needs to be its own page. Either called "Stories" or "Success Stories" or "Examples", and shown on the upper right hand corner with the other five pages.

[09:43, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Ok noted!!

[09:43, 11/21/2025] Andrew Parris: Also reachable from the other pages.

[09:44, 11/21/2025] Thomas Schwab: Yep that would be definitely
