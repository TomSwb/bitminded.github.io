## 📊 Volume Strategy Analysis

### Strategy: Lower Price = Higher Volume

**Philosophy:** Focus on quantity of subscribers vs. amount per subscriber. Make catalog access accessible to "petite gens" (ordinary people), not just businesses.

### Revenue Targets

| Price Point | Subscribers Needed | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue (after tax ~25%) |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| CHF 5/month | 1,000 | CHF 5,000 | CHF 45,000 |
| **CHF 8/month** | **625** | **CHF 5,000** | **CHF 45,000** |
| CHF 10/month | 500 | CHF 5,000 | CHF 45,000 |
| CHF 18/month (current) | 278 | CHF 5,000 | CHF 45,000 |

### Recommended: CHF 8/month

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Accessible to "petite gens" (price of a coffee)
- ✅ Achievable volume (625 subscribers is realistic)
- ✅ Better economics than CHF 5/month
- ✅ Lower barrier than CHF 18/month
- ✅ Sustainable for Vaud living costs

### Calculations (CHF 8/month)

**Gross Revenue:**
- 625 subscribers × CHF 8 = CHF 5,000/month

**After Stripe Fees (3%):**
- CHF 5,000 - CHF 150 = CHF 4,850/month

**After Tax (~25%):**
- CHF 4,850 × 0.75 = CHF 3,638/month = CHF 43,650/year

**Verdict:** Sustainable for one person in Vaud, especially with commissions and guidance services.

- **Delivery:** 6-12 weeks

**Characteristics:**
- Limited budgets compared to businesses

- Need personal touch and guidance
- Appreciate Swiss artisan quality at accessible prices

### Why Current Pricing Works

1. **Commissioning (CHF 40-50/hour):**

   - ✅ Not competing with premium agencies (CHF 80-150/hour)
   - ✅ Serves "petite gens" market effectively
   - ✅ Sustainable for full-time work (35-45 hours/week)

   - ✅ Accessible pricing for families and individuals
   - ✅ Fits Vaud market expectations
   - ✅ Complements commissioning services
   - ✅ Builds relationships and trust

3. **Catalog Access (Current: CHF 18/month, Proposed: CHF 8/month):**

   - ✅ Lower barrier = more subscribers

### Capacity Analysis (35-45 hours/week)

**Per Month (160-180 hours):**

- 5-8 guidance sessions (prep + delivery) = 10-20h
- Admin/marketing/catalog work = 30-40h
- Buffer = 10-20h
- **Total: 140-180 hours/month** ✅ Fits capacity

**Revenue Potential:**
- 2 commissions/month: CHF 2.4k-3.0k
- 5-8 guidance sessions: CHF 350-1,440

**Rationale:**
- Focus on accessibility, not premium positioning
- Serve individuals and small projects

**Rationale:**
- Apps vary significantly in complexity
- Simple apps can be built in 1 week (1 sprint)
- Complex apps may need 3-4 sprints
