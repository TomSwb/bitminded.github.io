## 📊 Volume Strategy Analysis

### Strategy: Lower Price = Higher Volume

**Philosophy:** Focus on quantity of subscribers vs. amount per subscriber. Make catalog access accessible to "petite gens" (ordinary people), not just businesses.

### Revenue Targets

| Price Point | Subscribers Needed | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue (after tax ~25%) |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| CHF 5/month | 1,000 | CHF 5,000 | CHF 45,000 |
| **CHF 8/month** | **625** | **CHF 5,000** | **CHF 45,000** |
| CHF 10/month | 500 | CHF 5,000 | CHF 45,000 |
| CHF 18/month (current) | 278 | CHF 5,000 | CHF 45,000 |

### Recommended: CHF 8/month

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Accessible to "petite gens" (price of a coffee)
- ✅ Achievable volume (625 subscribers is realistic)
- ✅ Better economics than CHF 5/month
- ✅ Lower barrier than CHF 18/month
- ✅ Sustainable for Vaud living costs

### Calculations (CHF 8/month)

**Gross Revenue:**
- 625 subscribers × CHF 8 = CHF 5,000/month

**After Stripe Fees (3%):**
- CHF 5,000 - CHF 150 = CHF 4,850/month

**After Tax (~25%):**
- CHF 4,850 × 0.75 = CHF 3,638/month = CHF 43,650/year

**Verdict:** Sustainable for one person in Vaud, especially with commissions and tech support services.
