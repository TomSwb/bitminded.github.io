# Services Page Plan

- **Purpose:** Combine guidance/coaching offer, commissioning flow, and "How it works" into one cohesive services destination.
- **Top-Level Sections:**
  1. Overview hero reinforcing "We Build. We Guide." and clarifying who the services help.
  2. Tech Support (Tech Confidence Coaching, Quick Tech Help, Family Tech Connection) with formats, pricing ranges, and booking CTA.
  3. Commission a Tool (process outline, deliverables, licensing terms, intake form link).
  4. How It Works (shared steps from discovery → session/project → follow-up rituals/notes).
- **Support Content:** FAQs, safety/privacy assurances, and quick link to the contact/support page.
- **Integration Notes:**
  - Booking/scheduling system (Calendly or custom form) for coaching sessions.
  - Intake form for commissions with Supabase backend or email routing.
  - Cross-links to catalog entries referenced in case studies.
- **Design Considerations:**
  - Mission toggle callout that routes between service types.
  - Mobile-first layout for session descriptions and CTAs.
