## Important Notes

- **This is a template checklist, not legal advice.** Always consult with a Swiss lawyer before finalizing agreements, especially for:
  - High-value commissions
  - International clients
  - Clients in regulated industries
  - Complex IP arrangements

- **Swiss Contract Law Considerations:**
  - Swiss Code of Obligations (OR) applies
  - Consumer protection laws if dealing with consumers
  - Mandatory warranties under Swiss law cannot be fully excluded
  - Right of withdrawal may apply to distance contracts

- **Integration with Terms of Service:**
  - Commissioning agreements should reference the general Terms of Service
  - Commissioning-specific terms take precedence where they conflict
  - General terms (liability, dispute resolution) typically apply unless specifically modified

- **Regular Review:**
  - Review and update template agreements annually
  - Adjust based on experience and legal requirements
  - Keep track of any disputes or issues to improve future agreements

## Next Steps

1. Create a formal commissioning agreement template incorporating these elements
2. Have a Swiss lawyer review the template
3. Customize for each specific commission project
4. Ensure both parties sign before work begins
5. Store signed agreements securely with proper retention periods (10 years for Swiss businesses)
