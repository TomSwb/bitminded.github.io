      "tech-support-faq-2-question": "How do remote sessions work?",
      "tech-support-faq-2-answer": "Remote sessions are conducted via video call (Zoom, Google Meet, or your preferred platform). We'll send you a link before your session. During the call, we can share screens, walk through processes together, and guide you step-by-step. You'll still receive all the same notes, checklists, and recommendations as in-person sessions.",
      "tech-support-faq-3-question": "What should I prepare before a session?",
      "tech-support-faq-3-answer": "Before your session, think about what you'd like to accomplish or learn. Have any relevant devices, accounts, or questions ready. For remote sessions, ensure you have a stable internet connection and your device charged. For troubleshooting sessions, note any error messages or issues you've encountered. No technical knowledge is required—we'll guide you through everything.",
      "tech-support-faq-4-question": "Can I book multiple sessions?",
      "tech-support-faq-4-answer": "Absolutely! Many clients benefit from multiple sessions. Series and bundles offer discounted rates for multiple sessions. You can also book individual sessions as needed. We can help you choose the right package based on your goals—whether it's building confidence over time, learning specific skills, or ongoing support.",
      "tech-support-faq-5-question": "What happens after a session?",
      "tech-support-faq-5-answer": "After each session, you'll receive annotated notes summarizing what we covered, step-by-step checklists for future reference, and personalized recommendations for building healthy tech habits. For series and bundles, you'll get homework assignments between sessions. You can always reach out with follow-up questions, and we're available for additional sessions as needed.",
      "tech-support-faq-6-question": "Do you offer payment plans?",
      "tech-support-faq-6-answer": "Yes, we're flexible and can work with you on payment arrangements for series and bundles. Contact us to discuss payment plan options that work for your budget.",
      "tech-support-faq-7-question": "Can sessions be recorded for later reference?",
      "tech-support-faq-7-answer": "We provide detailed annotated notes and checklists after each session, which serve as your reference guide. Recording sessions can be arranged upon request for an additional fee. However, the notes and checklists are designed to capture everything important without needing a recording.",
      "tech-support-faq-travel-question": "How do in-person travel costs work?",
      "tech-support-faq-travel-answer": "For in-person visits, travel is billed at CHF 0.50/km from Vaulion or the last customer, with a minimum of CHF 5 and a maximum of CHF 40. We plan routes to minimize your cost, and we confirm the travel amount before your appointment.",
      "tech-support-faq-8-question": "Which languages do you support? Where do you travel for in-person?",
      "tech-support-faq-8-answer": "We offer sessions in English and French. In-person visits are available across the canton of Vaud and nearby areas; reach out if you’re unsure about your location.",
      "tech-support-faq-9-question": "Who qualifies for the reduced fare?",
      "tech-support-faq-9-answer": "Reduced fare is available for seniors, students, and people who are unemployed. If this applies to you, just let us know when booking.",

      "tech-support-faq-10-answer": "Cancellations within 24 hours of your appointment are billed at 50% of the session price. There is no fee for cancellations made earlier.",
      "tech-support-faq-11-question": "Can you help buy devices for me?",
      "tech-support-faq-11-answer": "Yes. We can procure new or second-hand devices based on your preferences and budget. Procurement is billed hourly plus the device cost; we add the device cost to your invoice with receipts.",
      "tech-support-faq-12-question": "How do you handle privacy and security?",
      "tech-support-faq-12-answer": "We never keep your passwords. If we need temporary access, we’ll guide you to change passwords afterwards. Notes we share avoid sensitive information, and we emphasize safe digital practices.",
      "tech-support-faq-13-question": "Do you provide accessibility accommodations?",
      "tech-support-faq-13-answer": "Yes. We adapt pace and materials for your needs—for example larger-print notes, clearer step-by-step checklists, and slower walkthroughs. Tell us what helps you most.",
      "tech-support-faq-14-question": "How do I book? Can family members join?",
      "tech-support-faq-14-answer": "Use the centralized booking at the bottom of this page. Our sessions are parent-focused; other family members can participate if helpful, but it isn’t full-family coaching.",
      "tech-support-faq-15-question": "Do you repair hardware?",
      "tech-support-faq-15-answer": "We focus on setup, configuration, learning, and smart home/console support. We don’t perform hardware repairs, but we can recommend options if needed.",

      "tech-support-faq-5-question": "Was passiert nach einer Sitzung?",
      "tech-support-faq-5-answer": "Nach jeder Sitzung erhalten Sie kommentierte Notizen, die zusammenfassen, was wir abgedeckt haben, Schritt-für-Schritt-Checklisten für zukünftige Referenz und personalisierte Empfehlungen für den Aufbau gesunder Technikgewohnheiten.
