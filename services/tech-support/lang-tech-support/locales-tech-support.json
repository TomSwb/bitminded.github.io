Series and bundles provide multiple sessions for deeper learning and habit-building.",
      "tech-support-faq-2-question": "How do remote sessions work?",
      "tech-support-faq-2-answer": "Remote sessions are conducted via video call (Zoom, Google Meet, or your preferred platform). We'll send you a link before your session. During the call, we can share screens, walk through processes together, and guide you step-by-step. You'll still receive all the same notes, checklists, and recommendations as in-person sessions.",
      "tech-support-faq-3-question": "What should I prepare before a session?",
      "tech-support-faq-3-answer": "Before your session, think about what you'd like to accomplish or learn. Have any relevant devices, accounts, or questions ready. For remote sessions, ensure you have a stable internet connection and your device charged. For troubleshooting sessions, note any error messages or issues you've encountered. No technical knowledge is required—we'll guide you through everything.",
      "tech-support-faq-4-question": "Can I book multiple sessions?",
      "tech-support-faq-4-answer": "Absolutely! Many clients benefit from multiple sessions. Series and bundles offer discounted rates for multiple sessions. You can also book individual sessions as needed. We can help you choose the right package based on your goals—whether it's building confidence over time, learning specific skills, or ongoing support.",
      "tech-support-faq-5-question": "What happens after a session?",
      "tech-support-faq-5-answer": "After each session, you'll receive annotated notes summarizing what we covered, step-by-step checklists for future reference, and personalized recommendations for building healthy tech habits. For series and bundles, you'll get homework assignments between sessions. You can always reach out with follow-up questions, and we're available for additional sessions as needed.",
      "tech-support-faq-6-question": "Do you offer payment plans?",
      "tech-support-faq-6-answer": "Yes, we're flexible and can work with you on payment arrangements for series and bundles. Contact us to discuss payment plan options that work for your budget.",
      "tech-support-faq-7-question": "Can sessions be recorded for later reference?",
      "tech-support-faq-7-answer": "We provide detailed annotated notes and checklists after each session, which serve as your reference guide. Recording sessions can be arranged upon request for an additional fee. However, the notes and checklists are designed to capture everything important without needing a recording.",
      "tech-support-faq-travel-question": "How do in-person travel costs work?",
      "tech-support-faq-travel-answer": "For in-person visits, travel is billed at CHF 0.50/km from Vaulion or the last client visited, with a minimum of CHF 5 and a maximum of CHF 40. To keep your costs low, we diligently plan routes—if multiple clients are booked the same day, each pays only the segment to their location.
