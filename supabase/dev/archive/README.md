# Archived Dev Files

Files kept for reference but no longer needed for daily use.

## What's Here

- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Initial dev environment setup guide (already completed)
- `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` - Environment variables guide (already configured)

## Why Archived?

These files were used during initial setup and are kept for reference, but you don't need them anymore since:
- Dev environment is already fully set up
- Environment variables are already configured
- The setup is complete

## If You Need Them

These files are still here if you need to:
- Reference the original setup
- Set up another dev environment
- Troubleshoot issues

## Active Files

For day-to-day work, use the files in the parent `/dev/` folder:
- `README.md` - Quick reference
- `pending-migrations.md` - Track pending SQL changes
- `deployed-functions.md` - Track deployed Edge Functions
